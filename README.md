This App was created while studying at the NYC Data Science Academy. The data is sourced from:

https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset  
https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data  
https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/#!/area/get_area

Data was cleaned and sorted using R, and the app was put together using https://shiny.rstudio.com/. FCC API was interacted with using python's Request library: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/.
